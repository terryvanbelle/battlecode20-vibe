# Handoff -- the state of the loop

Read `CLAUDE.md`, then `TRAINING_ALGORITHM.md`, `RULES.md`, this file, then the tail of
`TRAINING_LOG.md`.

## State (2026-09-23, evening)

- Phase 0 complete: engine on the driver and the VM, runner/gate/ladder tools ported and tested, replay dumper, unit tests.
- Incumbent and submission: `src/g_iter2` (accepted 29-3 over `g_iter1`). Iterations 3, 4 and 5 were rejected at the
  gate (TRAINING_LOG.md); the last lesson is that a role with a fixed station list needs a stall exit.
- `src/bot` = Iteration 6, the citadel (DESIGN.md "The citadel"): ring at Chebyshev 2, buildings sealed in the pocket,
  a drone ferry from the spawn tile F over the gate tile G, and after r750 a drone raid on the enemy ring. Diagnostics
  (`tools/citadel-diag.sh <map>` on `diag/citadel-<map>.*`) and 24-game quick-set sweeps against g_iter2 on the VM
  (`cit1` 9/24: early losses where too few landscapers reached the ring; `cit2` after the ring-full rule) drive the
  fixes; the gate is the usual SPRT mirror vs g_iter2 (`tools/mirror.sh`).
- Ladder: g_iter2 is 37/156 (24%) on the strong field over blocks 1-6; Elo 1372, rank 66/66 (`progress/ELO.md`).
- Benchmarks: 285 packages from 96 repos compiled (`~/projects/vibe/bc20-benchmarks/manifest.tsv`);
  the ladder field is `tools/ladder-bots.txt` (one bot per repo, chosen by name).
- Standing loop (owner, session cron every 30 min): keep the VM busy; if idle with nothing queued, start a new idea.

## Gotchas already known (from 2021, still true here)

- `pgrep -c battlecode.server.Main` counts two processes per game (the `timeout` wrapper).
- Kill `mirror.sh`/`gauntlet.sh` scripts, not their `xargs`; `gauntlet.sh` re-execs itself as
  `.reexec-gauntlet.<pid>`, so wait on the run directory's `summary.txt`, not on a process name.
- Never read a running batch as a result.
- `vm-sync.sh` replaces `src tools test progress` on the VM at every `vm-run.sh`.
- `git checkout` cannot undo a committed change to `src/bot`; restore from the snapshot with
  `for f in src/g_iterN/*.java; do sed 's/^package g_iterN;/package bot;/' "$f" > src/bot/$(basename $f); done`.
- 2020-specific: `rc.canMove` does not check water; `senseNearbyRobots` is row-major; a robot
  built this round acts next round; the blockchain block for round r is readable from r+1.
